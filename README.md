# 🌡️ React Temperature Converter
A simple web application built with React that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit, as well as increment or decrement the value.

This project was built as part of a web technology lab to demonstrate the core concepts of React, especially the useState hook.

# ✨ Features
Two-Way Conversion: Enter a temperature in Celsius and see the real-time Fahrenheit conversion, or vice-versa.

Unit Toggling: Switch the primary unit (C or F) with a single button.

Temperature Controls: Increase or decrease the temperature by one degree with + and - buttons.

Component-Based: The UI is broken down into small, reusable components.
